Fabric Manifesto
A Universal AI Fabric for Ethical, Decentralized Intelligence
📖 Overview
The Fabric Manifesto is the founding declaration of a new era for artificial intelligence:
Universal Execution: AI agents executed openly on a decentralized, policy-enforced fabric.
Immutable Provenance: Every action and mutation traced at the atomic level.
Perpetual Royalties: Developers earn forever from every fork of their creations.
DAO Governance: Evolution of the Fabric controlled by the community, not corporations.
Ethical Standards: Compliance, safety, and fairness embedded in the runtime itself.
This manifesto defines the vision, architecture, and roadmap for Fabric 1.0 → 2.0, setting the foundation for the first universal, decentralized AI infrastructure.
🏛️ Governance
DAO-Controlled Evolution: Future edits to this manifesto will only occur through on-chain Fabric DAO proposals and voting.
Provenance: Every manifesto version is signed and cryptographically verifiable.
Transparency: All proposals and governance decisions are stored on-chain and referenced in this repository.

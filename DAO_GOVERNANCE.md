Fabric DAO Governance
Decentralized Evolution of the Universal AI Fabric

1️⃣ Purpose
Fabric is designed to evolve without centralized control, ensuring that:
Policy rules are community-enforced
Royalty flows are transparently managed
Manifesto updates occur only through on-chain, cryptographically verified DAO votes
This document defines:
DAO structure
Proposal lifecycle
Voting mechanisms
Treasury management
Governance rules for modifying this manifesto and Fabric itself.

2️⃣ DAO Structure
DAO Treasury: Smart contract managing all royalty deposits and community funds.
DAO Token: Non-transferable governance weight (acquired via Genesis Deposit and XP system).
Proposal Engine: Contract enabling on-chain submission and voting on changes.
Royalty Router: Automatically distributes perpetual royalties to agent creators.

3️⃣ Proposal Lifecycle
Submission:
Any DAO member can submit a proposal using fab dao submit --proposal.
Proposals include:
Title and rationale
On-chain executable code (if protocol change)
Manifesto section references (if text update)
Review:
Proposal is live for 7 days discussion period.
Developers and stakeholders debate implications via DAO forum and GitHub PR.
Voting:
After review, DAO members vote on-chain using:
fab dao vote --proposal <id> --choice yes/no
Voting window lasts 5 days.
Execution:
If majority is reached and quorum met:
Protocol changes automatically executed via DAO contract
Manifesto edits merged into fabric-manifesto repo via DAO-linked GitHub action
All updates tagged with Proposal ID and transaction hash for provenance.

4️⃣ Voting Power
DAO token weight determined by:
Genesis Deposit
XP earned from forking and agent contributions
Non-transferable to prevent vote-buying.
Future upgrades to include quadratic voting to enhance fairness.

5️⃣ Treasury Management
Treasury funded by:
20% royalty flow from agent forks
Optional DAO contributions
DAO proposals can allocate treasury funds for:
Developer bounties
Compliance certifications
Ecosystem grants
All treasury outflows require DAO approval and on-chain multi-signature execution.

6️⃣ Manifesto Update Rules
Immutable Foundation:
This manifesto cannot be altered without DAO majority approval.
On-Chain Linking:
Each approved change references:
Proposal ID
On-chain vote transaction
GitHub commits cryptographically signed and verified.
Historical Archive:
All prior manifesto versions permanently stored in repo and DAO state for transparency.

7️⃣ Security and Audits
DAO smart contracts undergo:
Third-party security audits
Continuous fuzz testing
Governance scripts for fab-cli provide reproducible builds and verifiable transaction signing.

8️⃣ Governance Roadmap
Phase 1: Basic proposal and voting engine with treasury management.
Phase 2: Quadratic voting and delegated governance.
Phase 3: AI-assisted proposal synthesis via FabricGovernor meta-agent.
Phase 4: Cross-chain governance for Fabric Layer 2 ecosystems.

9️⃣ Call to Participate
The Fabric DAO is open to:
Developers
Ethical AI institutions
Regulatory observers
Enterprises
Community members who believe in decentralized AI infrastructure
Participation ensures:
Shared power: No centralized override
Economic fairness: DAO manages perpetual royalties for all
Transparency: Every decision recorded on-chain and reflected in this repository.
“No council, no board, no company should decide the future of AI—only a community bound by code, policy, and immutable consensus.”
